# Python Pizza Order Program
This Python program simulates a simple pizza ordering system. 
It allows users to choose their pizza size (small, medium, or large), whether they want pepperoni, and if they'd like extra cheese. 
The program calculates the total cost based on the selections and displays the final bill.
